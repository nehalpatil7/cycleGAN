# IMPLEMENTATION and ANALYSIS of CYCLE-CONSISTENT ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS for UNPAIRED IMAGE-TO-IMAGE TRANSLATION


### Objectives:
- The objective of this project is to implement the CycleGAN architecture to explore unsupervised image translation between two distinct image domains without relying on paired data.
- The project aims to replicate the results presented in the original paperâ€™s implementation & analyze the performance & limitations of CycleGANs.

### Findings:
- In this project, we implemented and evaluated the CycleGAN model for unpaired image-to-image translation across various domains.
- The results demonstrated that CycleGAN is effective in performing image translation tasks without requiring paired data, making it a versatile tool for applications where paired datasets are either unavailable or difficult to obtain.

### Limitations:
While CycleGAN has proven to be a powerful framework for unpaired image translation, several limitations were observed during this project:
- Style Fidelity
- Handling Abstract Domains
- Dynamic Hyperparameter Tuning
